# tub.dok

[tub.dok](https://tubdok.tub.tuhh.de) is the institutional Open Access repository of [Technische Universit√§t Hamburg-Harburg](https://www.tuhh.de). It is based on [DSpace CRIS](https://github.com/4Science/DSpace). The branch [tubdok-5_x_x-cris](https://github.com/tubhh/DSpace/tree/tubdok-5_x_x-cris) contains the derived source code we use at TUHH, containing all our local changes and customizations. Please understand, that most of the configs have been left untouched in git. Do not hesitate to ask if you have specific configuration questions about our code. We try to contribute our developments back to 4Science and to the original DSpace code, if that makes sense and there is time to do that.

More information about DSpace CRIS is in the [Duraspace Wiki](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACECRIS/DSpace-CRIS+Home) or at [4Science](https://www.4science.it/en/dspace-cris/). The source code is freely available on [github](https://github.com/4Science/DSpace).
More information about the original DSpace can be found on [http://www.dspace.org](http://www.dspace.org) and in [DSpace's official git repository](https://www.github.com/DSpace/DSpace).
