Hereby I transfer and assign to the University Library of the Hamburg University of Technology (TUB) the right to store electronically the documents submitted by myself and to make them publicly available through data networks.
The TUB gets non-exclusively the rights to copy and to disseminate my publication according to §§ 16 and 17 UrhG (German intellectual property law). I assure that no rights of third persons are violated with my publication. My own rights to use my publication in other forms or to publish them anywhere else are not affected by a publication on TUBdok. 

By this upload I agree, that my document will be saved and made available to the public electronically in a database handled by the TUB. The content of the document will not be changed by the TUB or other persons, technical changes (for example to convert it into other formats) for reasons of long-term archiving are explicitly permitted. The compilation of copies for digital preservation is also allowed explicitly. The TUB is allowed to submit my publication and the concerning metadata to the German National Library or other archiving institutions. The metadata will be made available via search engines and catalogs through the internet. 

In case my document has already been published elsewhere, I affirm explicitly that a publication on TUBdok is allowed in spite of the primary publication and that the rights of the primary publisher or another third person are not violated. In the event of getting notice about a possible violation of intellectual property rights after the publication of my document on TUBdok, I will inform the TUB immediately.

Without the need for a specific further approval of the authors, the TUB will be authorized to transfer the rights granted by this text completely or partially to third parties and to give ordinary rights of use under equal conditions to other repositories. This will be for example happen, in case the operator/host TUB will (in part) shut down the services or the operator/host will change its legal form and in case the public accessibility of the documents should be guaranteed nevertheless by means of a third party (for example an institution specialized in long-term digital preservation).

This is a translation of the German text of the “TUBdok Lizenzbestimmung” (TUBdok Distribution License) including the “Rechteübertragung” (transfer of intellectual property rights).
